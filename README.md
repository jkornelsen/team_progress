# Team Progress Kit: incremental + TTRPG

Produce, interact, and explore, driven by storytelling and chance.
Model a wide variety of ideas using descriptive text as building blocks.

A good place to start is the pre-built scenario "Bacon for Dinner."

For solo campaigns, it helps to track the narrative in a
document. If you know what a value ought to be but there isn't
any clear way to do it, go to settings and force the change,
then describe what happened in a way that fits.

## Server

The flexible, multiplayer design requires more on the server side
than normal idlers.
Websites such as pythonAnywhere can host this type of project.
To download and run on a home network, see [Installing](Installation.md).
