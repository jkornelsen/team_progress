# Team Progress Kit: incremental + TTRPG

Produce, interact, and explore, driven by storytelling and chance.
Model ideas using descriptive text as building blocks.

A good place to start is the pre-built scenario "Bacon for Dinner."

For solo role-playing scenarios, it helps to track the narrative in a
document, or use a story generator AI to write the narration
based on what happens.

If the story calls for a value that isn't handled automatically,
you can change it in settings at any time.

## Server

The flexible, multiplayer design requires more on the server side
than normal idlers.
Websites such as pythonAnywhere can host this type of project.
To download and run on a home network, see [Installing](Installation.md).
