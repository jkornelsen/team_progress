# Team Progress Kit â€” incremental + TTRPG

Produce, interact, and explore, driven by storytelling and chance.
Model ideas using descriptive text as building blocks.

A good place to start is the pre-built scenario *Bacon for Dinner*.

The original idea behind this game was to be an *incremental-plus*,
with roleplaying mechanics to provide the flexibility other idlers lack.
Like, maybe in the middle of production, employees from a rival factory
suddenly attack with staplers.

If you're not a divergent thinker,
you may still enjoy the *Rays* scenario,
designed like a standard idler and one of my favorite scenarios.

Anytime the story calls for a value that isn't handled automatically,
you can make the change in settings.
For solo role-playing scenarios, it helps to track the narrative in a
document, or use a story generator AI to write the narration
based on what happens.

## Server

The flexible, multiplayer design requires more on the server side
than normal idlers.
Websites such as *pythonAnywhere* can host this type of project.
To download and run on a home network, see [Installing](Installation.md).
